    "description": "he goal is to build an AI poker bot that can play multi-player, no-limit Texas Hold'em at any table (e.g., 6-max, 9-max). The bot must have a combination of GTO (Game Theory Optimal) play, reinforcement learning to adapt to different opponents, and opponent modeling to exploit weaknesses. It will make real-time decisions within 5 seconds, using OCR to read the game state and make decisions.\n\n1. Development Environment and Tools\nHardware:\n\nGPU: At least NVIDIA RTX 3060 or higher.\n\nCPU: Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7.\n\nRAM: 16GB or more.\n\nStorage: 500GB SSD for fast read/write speeds.\n\nSoftware:\n\nPython: Programming language.\n\nTensorFlow or PyTorch: For building and training the reinforcement learning models.\n\nOpenAI Gym: For creating a simulated poker environment.\n\nPyPokerEngine or OpenHold’em: For poker game simulations.\n\nTesseract OCR or Google Vision API: For capturing real-time game data from the screen.\n\n2. Create the Poker Game Environment\nMulti-Table Play: Set up the environment to support multi-player play (e.g., 6-max and 9-max). The AI should be able to handle different numbers of players at the table.\n\nThe bot will adapt to table size and adjust its strategies for multi-player dynamics (e.g., tighter play in a full table and looser play in short-handed games).\n\nImplement configurable tables: Ability to simulate various blinds, stack sizes, and player positions.\n\nGame Logic:\n\nImplement the basic poker game rules: dealing cards, betting rounds, showdown, hand ranking, etc.\n\nEnsure proper handling of game states: pre-flop, post-flop, turn, river, and showdown.\n\n3. GTO-based Strategy Integration\nGTO Solver Integration:\n\nUse pre-solved GTO strategies for the AI’s baseline decision-making.\n\nImplement PioSolver or GTO+ (or similar solvers) to get optimal strategies for opening ranges, bet sizing, and post-flop play.\n\nThis will serve as the foundation for the AI's play, ensuring it plays solidly in various situations.\n\nIncorporate GTO Data:\n\nLoad GTO strategies for each hand and situation. The bot will follow these strategies unless opponent modeling or reinforcement learning suggests a better alternative.\n\nThe GTO data should cover a variety of scenarios, including raise sizes, c-betting, check-raising, and bluffing.\n\n4. Build Reinforcement Learning (RL) System\nSelf-Play Training:\n\nImplement reinforcement learning where the AI learns by playing against itself. The bot will train using Deep Q Networks (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).\n\nQ-learning will be used to model optimal decisions (e.g., call, fold, raise) based on hand strength and game context.\n\nReward Function:\n\nDefine a reward function to provide feedback for actions:\n\nPositive rewards for winning pots, making correct value bets, folding losing hands.\n\nNegative rewards for losing money (e.g., over-bluffing, poor value betting).\n\nImplement exploration vs. exploitation balance, where the AI explores new strategies but also exploits what works against its opponents.\n\nOpponent Modeling:\n\nImplement a system to track opponent behavior (tight, loose, aggressive, passive) across multiple sessions.\n\nAllow the AI to adjust its strategy based on observed opponent tendencies:\n\nExploitative play: If the opponent is weak (e.g., calls too much), the AI will adjust by being more aggressive.\n\nTight players: The AI will adjust by bluffing less and value betting more.\n\nAdaptability:\n\nAllow the bot to switch strategies between GTO and exploitative play based on opponent tendencies.\n\nTrack and record opponent behaviors over time to fine-tune the AI’s adaptive strategies.\n\n5. OCR Integration for Real-Time Play\nScreen Capture:\n\nUse OCR (Optical Character Recognition) (Tesseract or Google Vision API) to capture game state data:\n\nPlayer's hand.\n\nCommunity cards.\n\nPot size and betting history.\n\nThe OCR should extract text and images from the poker client (e.g., PokerStars, 888poker).\n\nReal-Time Data Feeding:\n\nSend this captured data to the AI’s decision-making model for analysis.\n\nEnsure real-time processing to enable the AI to make decisions within 5 seconds of receiving the data.\n\n6. Decision Engine for Real-Time Actions\nDecision Making:\n\nOnce the game data is captured, the AI will process it and decide whether to fold, call, raise.\n\nThe AI’s decision will be based on:\n\nGTO strategies.\n\nOpponent behavior.\n\nCurrent game state (hand strength, position, stack size).\n\nOutputs should be clear instructions (e.g., “Raise $20”, “Fold”, “Call $15”).\n\nBet Sizing:\n\nImplement a bet sizing strategy based on the context, position, and opponent. The AI should vary its bet size to maximize EV (Expected Value).\n\nUse range balancing to ensure the AI doesn’t become predictable.\n\n7. Training, Testing, and Evaluation\nTraining and Self-Play:\n\nBegin training with self-play in a simulated environment. Let the AI play millions of hands to learn optimal strategies.\n\nEvaluate performance after every training cycle by comparing its performance to pre-solved GTO solutions.\n\nTesting Against Real Opponents:\n\nTest the AI against human players or other bots (e.g., low-level bots or GTO-based bots) to evaluate its adaptability and exploitation skills.\n\nMonitor the bot’s win rate, bluffing frequency, and adjustment to opponent behavior.\n\nTuning Hyperparameters:\n\nContinuously adjust the hyperparameters (learning rate, exploration-exploitation balance, etc.) to fine-tune the model’s performance.\n\n8. Real-Time Deployment and Integration\nIntegrate with Poker Client:\n\nEnsure seamless integration of the AI with poker platforms (e.g., PokerStars, 888poker).\n\nThe AI should be able to read the screen, process data, and output decisions in real-time.\n\nUser Interface:\n\nDevelop a simple interface that shows the AI’s decision-making process (e.g., Raise $20, Call $10).\n\nAllow users to track the AI’s performance and settings (e.g., select table size, change bet sizes, etc.).\n\n9. Monetization and Business Model\nSubscription Model:\n\nCharge users a monthly subscription fee for access to the AI. Provide basic functionality with premium upgrades for more advanced features (e.g., custom strategies, real-time advice).\n\nFreemium Model:\n\nOffer a free trial or a limited version of the AI (e.g., no multi-table support, limited strategies), and offer a premium version with full functionality for a subscription fee.\n\nMarketing:\n\nMarket to online poker players via social media, Twitch, and poker forums. Leverage affiliate marketing with poker platforms.\n\n10. Ongoing Maintenance and Updates\nRegular Updates:\n\nContinuously improve the AI’s performance by adding new features, updating strategies, and adapting to changes in the poker meta.\n\nRegularly test the bot against real players to ensure its effectiveness.\n\nBug Fixes and Optimization:\n\nAddress any bugs or inefficiencies in the system. Continuously optimize performance to reduce latency and improve decision-making speed.",

The app should be ultra-simple, safe, and trustworthy.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Core Concept\n\nUsers can:\n\t•\tScan a document (e.g. a letter or decision) → the app explains what it means\n\t•\tAsk a question by voice → the app answers clearly\n\t•\tAsk a question by typing → the app answers immediately\n\nThe app gives personalized, AI-generated answers. It does not store images or audio, but it should remember basic user preferences over time to provide better answers.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Interface (very simple)\n\nMain screen has just three buttons/icons:\n\t•\tCamera icon (scan a document)\n\t•\tMicrophone icon (ask by voice)\n\t•\tPen icon (ask by typing)\n\nAdditional screens:\n\t•\tInput screen (camera/mic/text)\n\t•\tResponse screen (shows AI-generated answer)\n\t•\tLogin screen (mobile number + SMS code)\n\t•\tSettings screen: view/edit profile, delete all data\n\nMax total: 5 screens\n\n⸻\n\n3. User Memory / Profile (cloud-based)\n\nTo personalize answers, the app stores a minimal, secure profile for each user:\n\n{\n  \"nickname\": \"Johan\",\n  \"tone\": \"direct and calm\",\n  \"language\": \"sv\",\n  \"topics\": [\"child law\", \"insurance\", \"school\"],\n  \"sensitive_topics\": [\"divorce\"],\n  \"last_questions\": [\n    \"What does this letter mean?\",\n    \"Can I refuse this meeting?\"\n  ]\n}\n\nStored securely in Firebase or Supabase.\nNo documents, images, or audio are saved.\nThis is only used to improve AI response quality and tone.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Privacy & Security\n\t•\tNo passwords or accounts – only mobile number + SMS verification\n\t•\tNo behavioral tracking\n\t•\tAll profile data is encrypted in the cloud\n\t•\tApp must be fully GDPR-compliant\n\t•\tUser can always delete their profile completely\n\n⸻\n\n5. Tech Stack Suggestions\n\nYou may choose the stack, but here’s a suggested stack:\n\t•\tFrontend: Flutter (or React Native)\n\t•\tOCR: Google ML Kit (on-device text recognition)\n\t•\tAI: OpenAI GPT-4o (for text understanding & generation)\n\t•\tBackend/DB: Firebase Firestore or Supabase\n\t•\tAuthentication: SMS login (Firebase Auth or similar)\n\n⸻\n\n6. Design & Tone\n\t•\tThe app should feel: friendly, smart, clear, and non-corporate\n\t•\tNo ads\n\t•\tNo dashboards\n\t•\tJust fast, human-style answers to real-life problems\n\t•\tThe assistant should “speak like the user” – calm, kind, or direct depending on preferences\n\n⸻\n\n7. Deliverables\n\t•\tFully working app (iOS + Android)\n\t•\tCodebase and deployment support\n\t•\tAll source files (code, design, AI logic)\n\t•\tAdmin access or instructions for future updates\n\t•\tHelp publishing to App Store & Google Play (if needed)",
