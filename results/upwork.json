I’m looking for a freelancer to take full ownership of this end-to-end project, delivering a clean implementation, beginner-friendly documentation, and clear explanations in non-technical terms. Scope of Work Azure Setup & Backend * Guide me to create an Azure account, set up billing, and configure: * Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4-turbo) * Azure App Service or Azure Functions (for backend hosting) * Azure Blob Storage (for storing 5 PDF documents) * Provide clear instructions or live guidance for setup, as I have no Azure experience. * Estimate monthly Azure costs (e.g., for OpenAI, hosting, PDF storage) and recommend cost optimization (e.g., auto-scaling, usage monitoring). Recreate My GPT in Code * Replicate the behavior of my “My GPT” assistant using the Azure OpenAI API: * System message (will be provided) * Tool use or function calling logic (if needed) * Integrate 5 PDF documents: * Recommend the best way to include these files (e.g., embedding, retrieval) and explain your approach in simple terms. * Ensure GPT uses PDF content for accurate answers (e.g., via text extraction or retrieval mechanism). Slack Integration * Create and configure a Slack App with: * A bot user that replies in specific channels or to DMs. * OAuth and proper permission scopes. * Connect the Slack App to the Azure backend to: * Receive messages, forward to GPT, and send replies back to Slack. * Optional: Basic context across a thread or user, only if simple and cost-effective (explain if you recommend this). Final Deliverables * Live Slack bot connected to Azure-hosted GPT * Deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub → Azure or manual). * Documentation written for a non-technical audience, with step-by-step instructions for: * Managing the system (e.g., updating PDFs, using the Slack bot and updating the GPT). * Basic troubleshooting (e.g., restarting the bot, checking logs). * A test plan to verify GPT accuracy (e.g., comparing responses to the original “My GPT”) and Slack bot functionality. About You You should have experience with: * Azure OpenAI Service (or OpenAI API with transition to Azure). * Azure App Service or Azure Functions. * Slack App development (Bolt.js or Python Slack SDK preferred). * Prompt engineering and GPT tuning. * File-based knowledge integration (e.g., PDF processing, embedding, or retrieval). * Guiding non-technical clients through technical setups, with excellent communication skills to explain concepts in plain language. Bonus if you’ve worked on: * Setting up Azure accounts from scratch or managing Azure costs for small projects. * Multi-user Slack bots or context-aware bots. * Logging/token usage monitoring or function-calling in GPT workflows. What I’ll Provide * My GPT’s system prompt. * 5 PDF documents. * Slack workspace and test channel. * Collaboration to create an Azure account with your guidance. * Quick feedback during the project. Timeline & Budget * I’d like to start ASAP and aim for a working Slack integration within 2–3 weeks if possible. * Please propose a realistic timeline with milestones (e.g., Azure setup, GPT coding, Slack integration). * I’m open to hourly or fixed-price bids. Please provide: * A rough estimate of your fees (hourly rate/total hours or fixed price). * Expected Azure costs (e.g., monthly costs for OpenAI, hosting, PDF storage). * Advice on keeping Azure costs low, as I have no experience with Azure pricing. * Optional: Availability for post-deployment support (e.g., 1–2 weeks of bug fixes or Q&A) is a plus. When Applying, Please Include * Examples of Slack bots, GPT deployments, or Azure projects you’ve done. * Experience with Azure OpenAI, Slack apps, and PDF integration with GPTs. * A brief plan for helping me set up an Azure account and managing costs. * Your approach to integrating the 5 PDFs with the GPT, explained in simple terms. * Preferred backend stack (e.g., Node.js, Python). * Proposed timeline with milestones. * Rough cost estimate (your fees + Azure costs). * Questions or suggestions for this project.",

This is a very straightforward task, and someone familiar with the tools should be able to finish it quite quickly. If you’ve already worked with Robocorp and Playwright before, this will be quick task. The job requires basic knowledge of automation concepts and how to interact with web elements using Playwright, along with an understanding of how to set up and run robots in the Robocorp environment. You should know how to structure a Robocorp project properly, organize tasks and environments using the robot.yaml file, and handle basic data flow through variables or environment configs. Familiarity with RCC and running tasks locally is also expected. You must be comfortable dealing with browser sessions, navigation, and DOM elements using Playwright, and ideally you should know how to troubleshoot common browser automation challenges like timeouts, selectors, and dynamic content. The task involves setting up a small script with logic that is typical in web automation. Nothing too complex or advanced, but attention to detail is important. You are expected to test the script thoroughly before submitting, and make sure everything runs without issues. If you're someone who has worked with Robocorp Work Items, Control Room, or browser-based RPA bots, that's a plus, though not mandatory for this specific task. Understanding how to handle page loading, selectors, and wait mechanisms in Playwright is crucial. Experience in managing robot environments with conda.yaml, handling credentials using environment variables, and setting up Google Sheets or similar integrations is also appreciated. The selected freelancer should be able to follow clear instructions, maintain clean code, and provide timely updates. You must have the ability to write maintainable and reusable scripts, with logging and basic error handling in place. Documentation is not mandatory for this task, but writing self-explanatory code will be considered a big plus. This is a one-time task but may lead to more work in the future. If you deliver quality work, I’ll be happy to bring you on board for similar projects. I frequently need small to mid-sized bots and automation flows built out, so there is definitely a scope for repeat work. Please make sure you're familiar with: Robocorp project structure Playwright with Python Handling browser sessions and automation with Playwright Using RCC and Robocorp Code extension in VS Code Basic environment management with conda.yaml Writing readable and clean Python code Reading and clicking web elements reliably Running robots from local machine The task will be shared after the contract is initiated, and you will have full support if you run into setup issues.
