Key Responsibilities Design and implement a user-friendly GUI application to launch, manage, and monitor multiple OBS Studio instances, each streaming different live sources. Develop modules to perform real-time Video OCR on live video streams to extract text appearing on screen. Integrate audio processing components to record audio streams and generate accurate transcripts in real time. Implement a keyword detection engine that continuously scans OCR output and audio transcripts for predefined trigger keywords. Build logic to trigger video recording segments starting 1 minute before and ending 5 minutes after the keyword trigger event. Handle multiple simultaneous keyword triggers efficiently by managing recording overlaps and minimizing duplicate recordings. Maintain precise timestamping for all triggers and recording segments to ensure timeline accuracy. Ensure stable and reliable software performance, handling stream interruptions and automatic reconnections gracefully. Optimize processing to support real-time performance with low latency. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate with external systems or APIs as needed. Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code following best practices. Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure robust functionality. Required Skills & Qualifications Strong proficiency in Python programming, including GUI frameworks such as PyQt, Tkinter, or Kivy. Experience with OBS Studio automation and integration, including launching and controlling multiple instances programmatically. Expertise in video processing libraries such as OpenCV, and OCR tools like Tesseract OCR or similar. Knowledge of audio processing and speech-to-text technologies, including APIs (Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Cognitive Services, etc.) or open-source alternatives. Ability to implement real-time data processing and event-driven programming. Experience with concurrency and parallel processing to handle multiple streams simultaneously. Strong understanding of multimedia streaming protocols and formats (RTSP, HLS, MPEG-DASH). Familiarity with timestamp synchronization and buffering techniques for pre-trigger and post-trigger recording. Experience handling complex trigger logic, de-duplication, and conflict resolution in event-driven systems. Solid knowledge of software design patterns, version control (Git), and testing methodologies. Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Preferred Qualifications Experience working with cloud services or APIs for speech recognition or video analysis. Familiarity with Docker or containerization for deploying multimedia applications. Prior exposure to real-time surveillance, broadcast automation, or media monitoring systems. Understanding of GUI/UX design principles for desktop applications. Ability to work independently and in a team environment. Deliverables Fully functional GUI software capable of managing multiple OBS instances streaming different live sources. Real-time OCR and audio transcription modules integrated with the live streams. Keyword detection and triggering system with accurate video segment recording. Mechanisms to handle overlapping triggers and minimize redundant recordings. Documentation covering installation, configuration, and user manual. Unit and integration test suites ensuring software quality. Application Instructions Please submit your resume along with a portfolio or examples of relevant projects involving multimedia processing, GUI application development, or OBS integration.",
