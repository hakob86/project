Multi-Tenant Auth0 Integration Implement tenant-aware user creation and assign unique tenant_id per company. Support role-based access: Admin, Manager, Rep. Store tenant/role claims in Auth0 app_metadata and JWT custom claims. Extend Auth0 Actions to enrich tokens. Create secure middleware to block cross-tenant access. Unit tests for RBAC, JWT validation, and permission escalation attempts. \n\n\n\n\n2. Event-Driven Ticketing System (Azure Functions) Azure Functions to detect: CRM/LMS gaps Low-performing calls Auto-generate Enablement Tickets (with tenant_id, owner_id, recommended_action, etc.). Support scheduled or manual triggers. Log ticket actions and ensure lifecycle status changes (Created, Assigned, Completed). Optimize for <500ms execution time and batch limits per tenant. \n\n\n\n\n3. Internal Writeback APIs (Tasks & Training) REST APIs for: POST /tickets/complete POST /trainings/create POST /tasks/complete Validate tenant and role permissions. Maintain audit logs and idempotent operations. Return consistent and secure responses. \n\n\n\n\n4. AI Console Feature Completion Real-time task/ticket delivery (SignalR, WebSockets, or polling). UI notifications for new items by role. LMS and Planner writeback integration. Report Builder with: AI summaries Chart/table previews Save + store metadata File upload module: Parse CSV/XLSX/TXT Inject summary into AI prompt Max size 5MB, type restrictions, malware scan \n\n\n\n\n5. ChatGPT Role-Based NLP Enhancements Inject dynamic instructions based on user role (AE, CRO, RevOps, etc.). Summarize uploaded files to enrich AI prompt. Respect token limits and fail gracefully. Log context and role injection per prompt. \n\n\n\n\nDeliverables Summary: Tenant-based Auth0 setup with enriched tokens Secure route-based access controls Azure Functions for pattern detection and ticket creation Full enablement ticket lifecycle management RESTful APIs for writebacks across tasks/trainings/tickets Real-time updates in AI Console AI-powered Report Builder with LMS/CRM context Dynamic NLP behavior based on user role and uploaded data Tech Stack: Auth0 (Actions, RBAC) Node.js or Python (Azure Functions) FastAPI or Express (Internal APIs) PostgreSQL / Supabase (Tenant-aware DB) SignalR or WebSockets ChatGPT API Apollo, LMS API integration Testing Requirements: Unit & integration tests for API, middleware, and Auth0 claims Permission escalation, cross-tenant isolation, token tampering scenarios Real-time function latency and throughput under load \n\n\n\n\nTimeline: 4–6 weeks (MVP-ready) \n\n\n\n\nIdeal Freelancer: Proven experience with multi-tenant SaaS architecture Deep familiarity with Auth0, JWT, and RBAC Prior work with Azure Functions is a must, the entirety of this project is in Azure. Strong in API development and security, data engineering, and ChatGPT prompt engineering \n\n\n\n\nBonus: Background in RevOps, sales tech, or enablement systems",
