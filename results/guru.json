Unit tests for RBAC, JWT validation, and permission escalation attempts. \n\n\n\n\n2. Event-Driven Ticketing System (Azure Functions) Azure Functions to detect: CRM/LMS gaps Low-performing calls Auto-generate Enablement Tickets (with tenant_id, owner_id, recommended_action, etc.). Support scheduled or manual triggers. Log ticket actions and ensure lifecycle status changes (Created, Assigned, Completed). Optimize for <500ms execution time and batch limits per tenant. \n\n\n\n\n3. Internal Writeback APIs (Tasks & Training) REST APIs for: POST /tickets/complete POST /trainings/create POST /tasks/complete Validate tenant and role permissions. Maintain audit logs and idempotent operations. Return consistent and secure responses. \n\n\n\n\n4. AI Console Feature Completion Real-time task/ticket delivery (SignalR, WebSockets, or polling). UI notifications for new items by role. LMS and Planner writeback integration.

    "description": "I need a software like monsterinsights.  Plug-in for websites to connect with Google analytics.  We are looking for a software engineer to help us build the next generation of our analytics platform.  You’ll be working on a small collaborative team to develop and maintain our core product.  We need someone who’s comfortable with front-end and back-end development and who’s passionate about building tools that help people understand data.  Proficient in languages like Python, JavaScript, and SQL is a must.  Experience with data visualization libraries is a plus.  Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud is also desirable.  Okay, here’s a bit more detail on each of those features:\n\n\n\n\nReal-time analytics dashboards:  these are live displays of key website metrics, like visitors count, page views, and traffic sources.  Think of it like a control center for your website’s performance.\n\n\n\n\nCustomizable reporting tools:  These allow users to create reports tailored to their specific needs.  You could filter data by date range, user demographics, or even specific actions on the site.\n\n\n\n\nIntegration with various e-commerce platforms:  This means the software can connect with platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce to track sales, conversions, and customer behavior.  It’s about making sure all the important data is in one place.\n\n\n\n\nUser behavior tracking and segmentation:  This feature lets you see how users interact with your site - what pages they visit, how long they stay, where they click!  Segmentation means grouping users based on their behavior, so you can target specific groups with tailored content.\n\n\n\n\nA/B testing and conversion rate optimization tools:  A/B testing lets you compare 2 versions of a webpage or element to see which performs better.  Conversion rate optimization is about making changes to your site to turn more visitors into customers.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so besides seeing what pages visitors look at, you can also track how long they stay on each page, what links they click on, and even where they move their mouse.  It’s all about understanding how people use my site.",

 We could also include a section with tips and advice for each stage of the application process.\n\nYou could add a professional networking company so users can connect with others in their field, share industry news, and even find mentors.  Think about including features like personalized job recommendations, skills and endorsements, and company pages where users can learn about potential employers.  You could include a feature where users can save job searches and get alerts when néw positions matching their criteria are posted.  Also, a mobile app version would be a plus, so people can search for jobs and manage their applications on the go.\n\nOkay, for a job board, you could have a free option with basic features, and then offer paid monthly subscriptions with more advanced tools.  Think about having a “premium” tier for job seekers, maybe with things like resume writing help or highlighting their applications.  And for recruiters, a “Pro” plan would include unlimited job postings, access to a larger pool of candidates, and detailed analytics.\n\nAlright, how about adding a section for company reviews and ratings?  That way, job seekers can get a better sense of the company culture before they even apply.  We could also include a salary comparison tool so people can see how their pay stacks up against others in the same field.\n\nOkay,here’s another idea, you could add a feature where users can create video resumes.  This could help them showcase their personalities and communication skills, which might make them stand out to potential employers.\n\nOkay, how about adding a section for online courses and certifications?  This could help users boost their skills and make their resumes more attractive to employers.  We could even partner with online learning platforms to offer discount or exclusivity content.\n\nHow about a feature where users can take personality assessments or skills tests?  This could help them identify their strengths and weaknesses, and match them with suitable openings.\n\nHow about adding a feature where users can create a digital portfolio to showcase their work samples and projects?
